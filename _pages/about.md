Research Interests
------------------

Laura Graham Holmes earned her degree B.A. from Florida State University and her M.S. and Ph.D. in
clinical psychology from the University of Utah with a focus on youth and families. Dr. Holmes
completed her capstone clinical training at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) as a
fellow in the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities (LEND) program and the Center
for Autism Research. Dr. Holmes completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Life Course Outcomes
Research Program at the A. J. Drexel Autism Institute, where she collaborated with social workers to
conduct community-engaged research on sexual and reproductive health services among autistic youth
and adults. She completed a second postdoctoral research fellowship at the Boston University School
of Public Health on adolescent risk behavior interventions for autistic adolescents. Her agenda is
to improve social-behavioral interventions for autistic adolescents and adults with a focus on
participatory and mixed-methods research to enhance quality of life. Most recently, Dr. Holmes was
invited to join the Autism Intervention Research Network – Physical Health (AIR-P) as a leader in
the Sexual and Reproductive Health node.

Dr. Holmes has a decade of experience providing evidence-based clinical assessment, intervention,
and consultation with a particular focus on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). She has provided
care for adults, children, and adolescents across settings including rural community mental health,
inpatient and partial hospitalization units, a clinic serving youth experiencing homelessness,
autism specialty clinics, and the world-class CHOP and University of Pennsylvania hospital systems.

At Silberman School of Social Work, Dr. Holmes teaches courses such as Human Behavior & Social
Environment II, and Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Across the Lifespan.
